## Nox
Occupation: Choreographer

Current Residence:  Studio apartment in the East Village

Description:  ![Nox](https://scontent-mia1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12088119_1193734720641360_2238844526729660745_n.jpg?oh=fdec6e16f1b901533855e7f3bcbdbd2f&oe=57CE8EA8) Nox is 6'0" weighing approximately 145 lbs with a hard to maintain thin athletic build. He has chocolate brown eyes framed with a thick set of eye lashes any woman would die for that he adds black eyeliner to for emphasis. Nox typically sports a side swept undercut that is naturally a chestnut color but he tends to dye it black with varying highlights usually orange, crimson or sapphire blue. His facial hair kept at a perpetual five o'clock shadow - manicured perfectly. Nox almost always has a playful grin plastered on his lips, like everything's a joke to him.

Nox's attire is typically plain t-shirts and jeans with a long sleeved button down shirt over top.

There are scars running the length of his back from a leather belt with metal studs in it as well as an angry scar on his chest near his left shoulder from repeated cigaratte burns, there are other random circles from cigaratte burns scattered across his chest and sides.

Nox has two tattoos - one a capital letter G on his neck about a three finger width from his left ear.  And just to the right of his left hip bone of ball with the letter G 'etched' in it and chain that encircld the ball, a black ring encircles the chain where a name was once written.

Everything about Nox is long and thin, his fingers, his legs, his arms and even his torso - he has the body of a dancer.

History:

Nox was an abused child removed from his home in Hell's Kitchen when his step-father beat him to near death.  Nox has lived with the Austin family since he was 10 in foster care on the Upper East Side.  The only thing that ever seemed to make Nox happy away from his family was dancing.  The Austins encourgaged his dancing and helped Nox pay for his Masters at [NYU Tisch](http://tisch.nyu.edu/dance) in Dance.  He also took up Aikido when he was first with the Austins in order to learn to defend himself which helped his confidence. Nox is currently working on the set of a TV show as choreographer.

Nox has never been in a lasting relationship preferring short term sexual encounters rather than letting anyone in who could hurt him.  Even on the set he's known as quite the playboy.  Nox leans heavily towards men in any lasting relationship, but most of his exploits have been with women.  

There are two casual relationships that Nox has in engaged in long term.  One with a protector/gang member/leader when he was young who treated him like property but it kept him safe from everyone other than his step-father in a culture where being gay was highly frowned upon. Even after being removed from the ghetto the relationship lasted because Nox would run away to see his mother and G.

And the later in life with his friend Dawn, who mostly treated him as her gay best-friend except that they had sex together when she felt the desire or was in a dry spell.  Dawn is currently in an on-phase without a boyfriend.
